While I have led the initiatives reflected in the samples below, I certainly have not done it alone. Each sample reflects a team effort. . STEM Certification . I am honored to lead ECCA&#39;s pursuit of STEM certification, which includes the whole school, STEM and CTAE alike. Below are samples the faculty and STEM Leadership Team have developed as part of the effort. . Intro to PLC&#39;s . A short video reflecting groundwork laid to prepare for our first professional learning community meeting, or PLC . STEM Fundamentals . The STEM Leadership team developed the following foundation for STEM and created a presentation for how to apply it to problem- and project-based units. Throughout, the Cognia (AdvancED) STEM Standards have guided our development, and we have constantly sought feedback from stakeholders. . STEM Definition: STEM is practical, real-world learning . ECCA Vision: Preparing students to develop practical solutions to real-world problems . Framework: STEM adheres to the following framework: Inquiry- or project-based units of study, integrated across multiple disciplines, in which students collaborate and are self-directed, guided by teachers, and assessed on the quality of their performance. In addition, students have opportunities to work with mentors and share their work with others. . The Process: The engineering design process is a key component of STEM teaching &amp; learning. Working with a team of teachers and under the direction of our principal Ashley Kieffer, we developed the following graphic representation of what we simply call &quot;the process&quot;, as it is intended to be used in all courses, not just engineering. . PLC Presentation: Describes the foundation for STEM with examples of what practical, real-world learning might look like. . Note: STEM here refers to teaching &amp; learning in both STEM and CTAE courses. . Day-to-Day Leadership . Examples of leadership from a daily management perspective . Celebrating Success . ECCA senior Skylar Kennett earned a full scholarship to Georgia Tech. I wrote this blog post to celebrate her succes. . . Working with Students . STEM Leadership determined a need to improve displays of student work within the building, to better reflect the STEM culture. I mentioned the idea of a touchscreen display for visitors entering the building. Senior Mathiew Tackitt took the idea and ran with it, developing a splash screen for the display, which will eventually link to information specifically for parents, students, and other visitors. . . Traffic Management . Traffic exiting the parking lot gets quite congested. I created this video to help alleviate some of the congestion, and Kim Larson added graphics to it. . Presenting to Research . Dr. Thompson invited me to present to her scientific research classes on my hobby of data science, machine learning, and deep learning. I wrote this blog post highlighting the main ideas from the presentation. . .",

            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 .

I invite you to look over my resume and explore the samples in this portfolio to get a feel for who I am and the type of work I do. . I have spent 20+ years in K-12 schools, the past 11 as a leader. I started out as an English teacher and coach and held a couple of public relations positions before moving into leadership. Currently, I am an Assistant Principal, leading the Effingham College &amp; Career Academy’s pursuit toward STEM certifiation. . Outside of work, I enjoy my family, playing tennis, and pursuing whatever learning challenges strike my fancy. I love to read, particularly literary nonfiction. A few years ago, I began to venture into new learning territory, narrating a few audibooks under the pseudonym Wayne Paige. Strangely enough, this led me to an interest in data science, machine learning, and deep learning, so for the past three years, I have pursued that interest through courses at Udacity1 and fast.ai2 and data science competitions at kaggle3. .
